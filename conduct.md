# Algorave - Code of Conduct
All participants at the Algorave are required to agree with the following code of conduct. "Participants" extends to all attendees, performers, organisers and volunteers. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## What Is This?
The Algorave should be and inclusive safe event for performers, organisers and attendees. For this reason, we have established a clear code of conduct that outlines precisely how we define expectations from all participants. This code also applies to any related social events around the Algorave, and extends to online communities and discourse.

## The Short Version
Algorave is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of performers, audience members or staff/volunteers in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for an Algorave, including audio or visual performances and extending to feedback and discussion in person or via online media. Algorave participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the Algorave organisers.

## The Less Short Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Organisers and volunteers are also subject to all parts of this code of conduct.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, contact an organiser immediately. Algorave organisers will make themselves known ahead of time, and will try to be present at all times - additionally, venue staff (where possible/appropriate) will be briefed on this code and can act on the organisers behalf.

Algorave organisers and venue staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the Algorave itself, at related social events, and during discourse in person or online.
